  I want to be able to get, post, update and delete todos

  Scenario Outline: Add a new to-do task (GET and POST Todo)
    Given I get a list of to-dos
    And I delete all the existing to-do tasks
    When I add a new task with title <title>
    Then I should get a response with an id, title <title> and a task resolved status as <taskResolvedStatus>
